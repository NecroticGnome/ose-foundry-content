Victims are completely helpless while held by the snake (1d4 turns, or released as the wielder of the staff commands).</li>\n<li><strong>Snake:</strong> Has AC 5 [14], HD 3 (20hp), and a movement rate of 60′ (20′).</li>\n<li><strong>When the victim is released:</strong> The snake returns to the owner and transforms back into a staff. (At this point, it is healed of any damage it has suffered.)</li>\n<li><strong>If the snake is killed:</strong> It does not return to its staff form, becoming non-magical.</li>\n<li><strong>No charges:</strong> Does not use charges; may be used any number of times.</li>\n</ul>",
