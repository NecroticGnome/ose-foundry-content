When this number is reached, it becomes safe to look into the mirror.</li>\n<li><strong>Inside the mirror:</strong> A creature will live indefinitely, without the need for air or sustenance, and unaffected by ageing.</li>\n<li><strong>Communication:</strong> Trapped creatures may converse with those outside, but are utterly powerless.</li>\n<li><strong>Breaking the mirror:</strong> Releases those trapped.</li>\n</ul>",
