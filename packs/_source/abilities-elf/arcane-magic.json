This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When an elf reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Spell casting:</strong>&nbsp;Elves carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The level progression table (opposite) shows both the number of spells in the elf&rsquo;s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character&rsquo;s experience level. Thus, a 1st level elf has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to elves is provided in Cleric and Magic-User Spells (elves have the same spell selection as magic-users).</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Using magic items:</strong>&nbsp;As spell casters, elves are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands).</p>",
