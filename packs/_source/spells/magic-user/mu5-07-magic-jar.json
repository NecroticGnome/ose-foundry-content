From there, the caster may attempt to possess the bodies of other creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>When the caster&rsquo;s life-force is in the magic jar:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Possession:</strong> The caster may attempt to possess the body of another creature within 120'. The victim may <strong>save versus spells</strong> to resist possession. If the save is successful, the caster may not make another attempt to possess that victim for one turn. If the save fails, the caster&rsquo;s life-force leaves the magic jar and enters the victim, possessing it.</li>\n<li><strong>Returning: </strong>The caster may choose to return to their own body at any time, ending the spell.</li>\n<li><strong>If the magic jar is destroyed:</strong> The caster dies.</li>\n<li><strong>If the caster&rsquo;s own body is destroyed:</strong> Their life-force is stranded in the magic jar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>When the caster&rsquo;s life-force is possessing a victim:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Control:</strong> The caster gains full control over the victim&rsquo;s body, but is not able to make the victim cast spells.</li>\n<li><strong>If the magic jar is destroyed:</strong> The spell ends and the caster&rsquo;s life-force is trapped in the possessed body.</li>\n<li><strong>If the possessed victim is killed:</strong> The caster&rsquo;s life-force returns to the magic jar.</li>\n<li><strong>Dispelling:</strong> <em>Dispel evil</em> forces the caster&rsquo;s life-force back into the magic jar.</li>\n<li><strong>If the caster&rsquo;s own body is destroyed: </strong>Their life-force is stranded in the body of the creature being possessed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
