    "description": "<p>By concentrating (no movement allowed), the caster causes one of the following conditions to manifest around themselves. This spell only functions outdoors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Calm:</strong> Clears bad weather (though side-effects&mdash;e.g. mud after rain&mdash;remain.)</li>\n<li><strong>Extreme heat:</strong> Dries up snow or mud (including <em>transmute rock to mud)</em>. Creatures in the area move at half normal rate.</li>\n<li><strong>Fog:</strong> Visibility drops to 20'. Creatures in the fog move at half their normal rate. At the referee&rsquo;s option, they may also have a chance of getting lost.</li>\n<li><strong>High winds:</strong> Movement rates are halved. Missile fire and flight are impossible. High winds may be used to increase the sailing speed of ships by 50%, if they travel with the wind. In sandy areas, may cause a sandstorm, reducing visibility to 20'.</li>\n<li><strong>Rain: </strong>&ndash;2 penalty to missile attacks. Mud forms in 3 turns, halving movement rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Snow:</strong> Visibility drops to 20'. Movement rates are halved. Bodies of water may freeze. After the snow thaws, mud remains and still impedes movement.</li>\n<li><strong>Tornado:</strong> The caster can direct the @Compendium[ose-content.monsters.bGh9lgT1rzkqwOXu]{Tornado}, which moves at 120â€² per round. The tornado can be directed to attack (see stats below). Ships caught in a tornado have a 75% chance of suffering 12 points of hull damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tornado</h2>\n<p>A whirling column of air, 24' high and 6' across, that wreaks havoc for flying creatures and ships.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>AC</strong> 0 [19], <strong>HD</strong> 12* (54hp), <strong>Att</strong> 1 &times; blow (2d8), <strong>THAC0</strong> 10 [+9], <strong>MV</strong> 360' (120') flying, <strong>SV</strong> D6 W7 P8 B8 S10 (12), <strong>ML</strong> 10, <strong>AL</strong> Neutral, <strong>XP</strong> 1,900</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whirlwind:</strong> Creatures with less than 2HD swept aside (<strong>save versus death</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Mundane damage immunity:</strong> Can only be harmed by magical attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Harm flying creatures:</strong> Inflict extra [[/r 1d8]] damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
