    "description": "<p>A visual illusion of the caster&rsquo;s choosing manifests in a 20â€² cube area. Three types of illusion may be created:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>An illusionary monster: </strong>That can be directed to attack.The monster has an Armour Class of 9 [10] and will vanish if hit in combat.</li>\n<li><strong>An illusionary attack:</strong> For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets <strong>who save versus spells</strong> are unaffected.</li>\n<li><strong>A scene:</strong> Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Stipulations:</strong> The following apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves or loses concentration, the spell ends.</li>\n<li><strong>Illusionary monsters or attacks:</strong> May appear to be harmful but no real damage is ever inflicted. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last for [[/r 1d4 #Turns]] turns.</li>\n<li><strong>Illusions from imagination:</strong> If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.</li>\n</ul>",
