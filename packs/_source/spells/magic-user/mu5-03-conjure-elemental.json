    "description": "<p>A 16 Hit Dice <strong>Greater Elemental</strong>&mdash;a being formed of pure elemental matter is summoned from an elemental plane of the caster&rsquo;s choice (air, earth, fire, water) to do the caster&rsquo;s bidding.</p>\n<p><strong>Materials:</strong> The summons requires a large volume of the appropriate element.</p>\n<p><strong>Concentration:</strong> Is required to command an elemental.</p>\n<p><strong>Dismissing: </strong>While control over the elemental is maintained, the caster may dismiss it at any time, sending it back to its plane of origin.</p>\n<p><strong>Disruption:</strong> If the caster moves at more than half speed or their concentration is disturbed, the command over the elemental ends. It is, henceforth, a free-willed entity and will immediately try to kill the caster and any who get in its way.</p>\n<p><strong>Dispelling:</strong> A conjured elemental may be dispelled by <em>dispel magic</em> or <em>dispel evil</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> The caster may summon at most one elemental from each plane in a single day.</p>",
